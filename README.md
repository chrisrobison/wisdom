## Quick start

This repo is totally self-contained with no external dependencies besides a web browser.

All advice data is stored as JSON in "advice.json" file.  The "index.html" file simply loads
the JSON advice data and renders it as a HTML ordered list.

- Step 1: Clone this repository. 
- Step 2: Open the file "index.html" in a modern web browser.
- Step 3: Read and become enlightened.

## Status

This list will continue to be added to as new or updated advice is learned.

## What's included

A little wisdom; a bit of advice; a LOT of experience and a dash of opinion.
